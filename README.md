<h1>Early Detection, Better Outcomes: Machine Learning In Cardiovascular Care </h1>
<p>
  Hi There! I am Arshiya, and this is Mehar, well you can't see us, but take a look at us in the notebook or slides ;) This is part of our SC1015 Intro to Data Science & Artificial Intelligence, our mini project!
</p>

<p>
  Our project is about Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning Techniques, so grab a popcorn, and a drink, and you're in for a long ride :)
</p>
<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Our dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction. The contents are as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>Data Extraction & Preperation</li>
  <li>Functions</li>
  <li>EDA</li>
  <li>Cleaning & Feature Selection</li>
  <li>Machine Learning Models</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  For Exploratory Data Analysis, we take a look at the univariate analysis, bi-variate analysis, and finally, multi-variate analysis. We learn some insights that will be helpful for our feature selection.
</p>
<p>
  For Cleaning we remove outliers and impute missing data. For feature selection, we normalize and standardize the data, and do a correlation matrix followed by the chi-squared test and the ANOVA test.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, for our models, we have implemented Multi-Layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression, and last but not least Random Forest Classifier.

<h1> Problem Definition</h1>
<p>
The motivation for this project stems from the urgent need to address the global burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Despite significant advancements in medical science, CVD remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide, claiming millions of lives each year. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms and utilising various risk factors we aim to develop predictive models capable of identifying individuals at heightened risk of developing heart disease. This approach holds the potential to revolutionise cardiovascular healthcare by enabling healthcare professionals to intervene early, thereby the mortality rate associated with CVD.

  Problem Statement: Developing a Personalised Risk Assessment for Early Detection of Heart Disease
</p>

<h1>Models Used</h1>
<ul>
  <li>MLP - Accuracy 80%</li>
  <li>Logistic Regression - 85%</li>
  <li>Random Forest - 80%</li>
</ul>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Understand and take care of your heart as you get older
</li>
  <li>
    Men are more likely to get heart disease than women

  </li>
  <li>
    Experiencing certain types of chest pain, exercise-induced angina, and high levels of fasting blood sugar puts a person more at risk of heart disease
  </li>
</ul>
